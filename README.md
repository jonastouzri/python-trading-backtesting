# Python Trading Backtesting

Clean, minimal Python examples for trading strategy backtesting with a focus on
**clear architecture, reproducibility, and risk-aware evaluation**.

This repository is intentionally kept simple and realistic — no hype, no curve fitting,
no promises of profitability.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how trading and backtesting systems can be
implemented in a **clean, maintainable, and extensible way** using Python.

The focus is on:
- proper separation of concerns
- realistic backtesting flow
- transparent performance evaluation

This repository is meant as a **technical reference**, not a turnkey trading system.

Included in this repository:

- Candle-by-candle backtesting engine
- Simple example strategies (signal-only logic)
